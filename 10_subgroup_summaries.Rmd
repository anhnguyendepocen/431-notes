# Summarizing data within subgroups

## Using dplyr and summarise to build a tibble of summary information

Suppose we want to understand how the subjects whose diet involved consuming much more than usual yesterday compare to those who consumer their usual amount, or to those who consumed much less than usual, in terms of the energy they consumed, as well as the protein. We might start by looking at the medians and means.

```{r}
nnyfs %>%
    group_by(diet_yesterday) %>%
    select(diet_yesterday, energy, protein) %>%
    summarise_all(list(median = median, mean = mean))
```

Perhaps we should restrict ourselves to the people who were not missing the `diet_yesterday` category, and look now at their `sugar` and `water` consumption.

```{r}
nnyfs %>%
    filter(complete.cases(diet_yesterday)) %>%
    group_by(diet_yesterday) %>%
    select(diet_yesterday, energy, protein, sugar, water) %>%
    summarise_all(list(median))
```

It looks like the children in the "Much more than usual" category consumed more energy, protein, sugar and water than the children in the other two categories. Let's draw a picture of this.

```{r}
temp_dat <- nnyfs %>%
    filter(complete.cases(diet_yesterday)) %>%
    mutate(diet_yesterday = fct_recode(diet_yesterday,
        "Much more" = "1_Much more than usual",
        "Usual diet" = "2_Usual",
        "Much less" = "3_Much less than usual"))

p1 <- ggplot(temp_dat, aes(x = diet_yesterday, y = energy)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = diet_yesterday), width = 0.2) +
    theme_light() + 
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Energy Comparison")

p2 <- ggplot(temp_dat, aes(x = diet_yesterday, y = protein)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = diet_yesterday), width = 0.2) +
    theme_light() + 
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Protein Comparison")

p3 <- ggplot(temp_dat, aes(x = diet_yesterday, y = sugar)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = diet_yesterday), width = 0.2) +
    theme_light() + 
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Sugar Comparison")

p4 <- ggplot(temp_dat, aes(x = diet_yesterday, y = water)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = diet_yesterday), width = 0.2) +
    theme_light() + 
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Water Comparison")

p1 + p2 + p3 + p4
```

We can see that there is considerable overlap in these distributions, regardless of what we're measuring.

## Another Example

Suppose now that we ask a different question. Do kids in larger categories of BMI have larger waist circumferences?

```{r}
nnyfs %>%
    group_by(bmi_cat) %>%
    summarise(mean = mean(waist), sd = sd(waist), 
              median = median(waist), 
              skew_1 = round((mean(waist) - median(waist)) / 
                                 sd(waist),2))
```

Oops. Looks like we need to filter for cases with complete data on both BMI category and waist circumference in order to get meaningful results. We should add a count, too.

```{r}
nnyfs %>%
    filter(complete.cases(bmi_cat, waist)) %>%
    group_by(bmi_cat) %>%
    summarise(count = n(), mean = mean(waist), 
              sd = sd(waist), median = median(waist), 
       skew_1 = 
         round((mean(waist) - median(waist)) / sd(waist),2))
```

Or, we could use something like `favstats` from the `mosaic` package, which automatically accounts for missing data, and omits it when calculating summary statistics within each group.

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(waist ~ bmi_cat, data = nnyfs) %>%
    kable(digits = 1)
```

While patients in the heavier groups generally had higher waist circumferences, the standard deviations suggest there may be some meaningful overlap. Let's draw the picture, in this case a comparison boxplot accompanying a violin plot.

```{r}
nnyfs %>%
    filter(complete.cases(bmi_cat, waist)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = bmi_cat, y = waist)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = bmi_cat), width = 0.2) +
    theme_light() + 
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Waist Circumference by BMI Category")
```

The data transformation with dplyr cheat sheet found under the Help menu in RStudio is a great resource. And, of course, for more details, visit @R4DS.

## Boxplots to Relate an Outcome to a Categorical Predictor

Boxplots are much more useful when comparing samples of data. For instance, consider this comparison boxplot describing the triceps skinfold results across the four levels of BMI category.

```{r}
ggplot(nnyfs, aes(x = bmi_cat, y = triceps_skinfold,
                  fill = bmi_cat)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    theme_light()
```

Again, we probably want to omit those missing values (both in `bmi_cat` and `triceps_skinfold`) and also eliminate the repetitive legend (guides) on the right.

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(bmi_cat, triceps_skinfold)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = bmi_cat, y = triceps_skinfold,
                  fill = bmi_cat)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    theme_light() +
    labs(x = "BMI Category", y = "Triceps Skinfold in mm",
         title = "Triceps Skinfold increases with BMI category",
         subtitle = "NNYFS children")
```

As always, the boxplot shows the five-number summary (minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile and maximum) in addition to highlighting candidate outliers. 

### Augmenting the Boxplot with the Sample Mean

Often, we want to augment such a plot, perhaps by adding a little diamond to show the **sample mean** within each category, so as to highlight skew (in terms of whether the mean is meaningfully different from the median.)

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(bmi_cat, triceps_skinfold)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = bmi_cat, y = triceps_skinfold,
                  fill = bmi_cat)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    stat_summary(fun="mean", geom="point", 
                 shape=23, size=3, fill="white") +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    theme_light() +
    labs(x = "BMI Category", y = "Triceps Skinfold in mm",
         title = "Triceps Skinfold increases with BMI category",
         subtitle = "NNYFS children")
```

### Building a Violin Plot

There are a number of other plots which compare distributions of data sets. An interesting one is called a **violin plot**. A violin plot is a kernel density estimate, mirrored to form a symmetrical shape. 

```{r}
nnyfs %>%
    filter(complete.cases(triceps_skinfold, bmi_cat)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=bmi_cat, y=triceps_skinfold, 
                  fill = bmi_cat)) + 
    geom_violin(trim=FALSE) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = "none") +
    labs(title = "Triceps Skinfold by BMI Category")
```

Traditionally, these plots are shown with overlaid boxplots and a white dot at the median, like this example, now looking at waist circumference again.

```{r}
nnyfs %>%
    filter(complete.cases(waist, bmi_cat)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = bmi_cat, y = waist, 
                  fill = bmi_cat)) + 
    geom_violin(trim=FALSE) +
    geom_boxplot(width=.1, outlier.colour=NA, 
                 color = c(rep("white",2), rep("black",2))) +
    stat_summary(fun=median, geom="point", 
                 fill="white", shape=21, size=3) + 
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = "none") +
    labs(title = "Waist Circumference by BMI Category")
```


### Adding Notches to a Boxplot

**Notches** are used in boxplots to help visually assess whether the medians of the distributions across the various groups actually differ to a statistically detectable extent. Think of them as confidence regions around the medians. If the notches do not overlap, as in this situation, this provides some evidence that the medians in the populations represented by these samples may be different.

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(bmi_cat, triceps_skinfold)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = bmi_cat, y = triceps_skinfold)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = bmi_cat), width = 0.3, notch = TRUE) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    theme_light() +
    labs(x = "BMI Category", y = "Triceps Skinfold in mm",
         title = "Triceps Skinfold increases with BMI category",
         subtitle = "NNYFS children")
```

There is no overlap between the notches for each of the four categories, so we might reasonably conclude that the true median triceps skinfold values across the four categories are statistically significantly different. 

For an example where the notches do overlap, consider the comparison of plank times by BMI category. 

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(bmi_cat, plank_time)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=bmi_cat, y=plank_time)) +
    geom_violin(aes(fill = bmi_cat)) +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, notch=TRUE) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = "none") + 
    theme_light() +
    labs(title = "Plank Times by BMI category", 
         x = "", y = "Plank Time (in seconds)")
```

The overlap in the notches (for instance between Underweight and Normal) suggests that the median plank times in the population of interest don't necessarily differ in a meaningful way by BMI category, other than perhaps the Obese group which may have a shorter time.

These data are somewhat right skewed. Would a logarithmic transformation in the plot help us see the patterns more clearly?

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(bmi_cat, plank_time)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=bmi_cat, y = log(plank_time))) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = bmi_cat), width = 0.3, notch=TRUE) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = "none") + 
    theme_light() +
    labs(title = "log(Plank Times) by BMI category", 
         x = "", y = "Natural Log of Plank Time")
```

## Using Multiple Histograms to Make Comparisons

We can make an array of histograms to describe multiple groups of data, using `ggplot2` and the notion of **faceting** our plot.

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(triceps_skinfold, bmi_cat)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=triceps_skinfold, fill = bmi_cat)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, color = "black") + 
    facet_wrap(~ bmi_cat) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = "none") +
    labs(title = "Triceps Skinfold by BMI Category")
```

## Using Multiple Density Plots to Make Comparisons

Or, we can make a series of density plots to describe multiple groups of data.

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(triceps_skinfold, bmi_cat)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=triceps_skinfold, fill = bmi_cat)) +
    geom_density(color = "black") + 
    facet_wrap(~ bmi_cat) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    guides(fill = "none") +
    labs(title = "Triceps Skinfold by BMI Category")
```

Or, we can plot all of the densities on top of each other with semi-transparent fills.

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(triceps_skinfold, bmi_cat)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=triceps_skinfold, fill = bmi_cat)) +
    geom_density(alpha=0.3) + 
    scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
    labs(title = "Triceps Skinfold by BMI Category")
```

This really works better when we are comparing only two groups, like females to males.

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(triceps_skinfold, sex)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=triceps_skinfold, fill = sex)) +
    geom_density(alpha=0.5) + 
    labs(title = "Triceps Skinfold by Sex")
```


## A Ridgeline Plot

Some people don't like violin plots - for example, see https://simplystatistics.org/2017/07/13/the-joy-of-no-more-violin-plots/. A relatively new alternative plot is available. This shows the distribution of several groups simultaneously, especially when you have lots of subgroup categories, and is called a **ridgeline plot**.

```{r}
nnyfs %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(waist, bmi_cat)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = waist, y = bmi_cat, height = ..density..)) +
    ggridges::geom_density_ridges(scale = 0.85) + 
    theme_light() +
    labs(title = "Ridgeline Plot of Waist Circumference by BMI category (nnyfs)",
         x = "Waist Circumference", y = "BMI Category")
```

And here's a ridgeline plot for the triceps skinfolds. We'll start by sorting the subgroups by the median value of our outcome (triceps skinfold) in this case, though it turns out not to matter. We'll also add some color.

```{r}
nnyfs %>%
    filter(complete.cases(bmi_cat, triceps_skinfold)) %>%
    mutate(bmi_cat = fct_reorder(bmi_cat,
                                 triceps_skinfold, 
                                 .fun = median)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = triceps_skinfold, y = bmi_cat, 
                  fill = bmi_cat, height = ..density..)) +
    ggridges::geom_density_ridges(scale = 0.85) + 
    scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "magma") +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Ridgeline Plot of Triceps Skinfold by BMI Category (nnyfs)",
         x = "Triceps Skinfold", y = "BMI Category") +
    theme_light()
```

For one last example, we'll look at age by BMI category, so that sorting the BMI subgroups by the median matters, and we'll try an alternate color scheme, and a theme specially designed for the ridgeline plot.

```{r}
nnyfs %>%
    filter(complete.cases(bmi_cat, age_child)) %>%
    mutate(bmi_cat = reorder(bmi_cat, age_child, median)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age_child, y = bmi_cat, fill = bmi_cat, height = ..density..)) +
    ggridges::geom_density_ridges(scale = 0.85) + 
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Ridgeline Plot of Age at Exam by BMI category (nnyfs)",
         x = "Age of Child at Exam", y = "BMI Category") +
    ggridges::theme_ridges()
```
