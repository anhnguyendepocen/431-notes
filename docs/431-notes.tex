\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{What You'll Find Here}

These Notes provide a series of examples using R to work through issues that are likely to come up in PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 431. What you will mostly find are brief explanations of a key idea or summary, accompanied (most of the time) by R code and a demonstration of the results of applying that code.

While these Notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give 431 students a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  reiterate points made in this document,
\item
  amplify what is here,
\item
  simplify the presentation of things done here,
\item
  use new examples to show some of the same techniques,
\item
  refer to issues not mentioned in this document,
\end{itemize}

but what we don't do is follow these notes very precisely. We assume instead that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you will attend classes and try to learn from them. We welcome feedback of all kinds on this document or anything else.

Everything you see here is available to you as HTML or PDF. You will also have access to the R Markdown files, which contain the code which generates everything in the document, including all of the R results. We will demonstrate the use of R Markdown (this document is generated with the additional help of an R package called \texttt{bookdown}) and RStudio (the ``program'' we use to interface with the R language) in class.

All data and R code related to these notes are also available to you.

\hypertarget{setting-up-r}{%
\section*{Setting Up R}\label{setting-up-r}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Setting Up R}

These Notes make extensive use of

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the statistical software language R, and
\item
  the development environment R Studio,
\end{itemize}

both of which are free, and you'll need to install them on your machine. Instructions for doing so are in found in the course syllabus.

If you need an even gentler introduction, or if you're just new to R and RStudio and need to learn about them, we encourage you to take a look at \url{http://moderndive.com/}, which provides an introduction to statistical and data sciences via R at \citet{ModernDive}.

These notes were written using R Markdown. R Markdown, like R and R Studio, is free and open source.

R Markdown is described as an \emph{authoring framework} for data science, which lets you

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  save and execute R code
\item
  generate high-quality reports that can be shared with an audience
\end{itemize}

This description comes from \url{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html} which you can visit to get an overview and quick tour of what's possible with R Markdown.

Another excellent resource to learn more about R Markdown tools is the Communicate section (especially the R Markdown chapter) of \citet{R4DS}.

\hypertarget{initial-setup-of-r-packages}{%
\section*{Initial Setup of R Packages}\label{initial-setup-of-r-packages}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Initial Setup of R Packages}

To start, I'll present a series of commands I run at the beginning of these Notes. These particular commands set up the output so it will look nice as either an HTML or PDF file, and also set up R to use several packages (libraries) of functions that expand its capabilities. A chunk of code like this will occur near the top of any R Markdown work.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

I have deliberately set up this list of loaded packages to be relatively small, and will add some others later in these Notes. You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it every time you start a new session.

\section*{Additional R Packages installed for this book}\label{additional-r-packages-installed-for-this-book}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Additional R Packages installed for this book}

Some packages need to be installed on the user's system, but do not need to be loaded by R in order to run the code presented in this set of notes. These additional packages include the following.

\begin{verbatim}
car

\hypertarget{data-science}{%
\chapter{Data Science}\label{data-science}}

The definition of \textbf{data science} can be a little slippery. One current view of data science, is exemplified by Steven Geringer's 2014 Venn diagram.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/data-science-venn20} \caption{Data Science Venn Diagram from Steven Geringer}\label{fig:datasci-fig}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The field encompasses ideas from mathematics and statistics and from computer science, but with a heavy reliance on subject-matter knowledge. In our case, this includes clinical, health-related, medical or biological knowledge.
\item
  As \citet{Gelman-Nolan} suggest, the experience and intuition necessary for good statistical practice are hard to obtain, and teaching data science provides an excellent opportunity to reinforce statistical thinking skills across the full cycle of a data analysis project.
\item
  The principal form in which computer science (coding/programming) play a role in this course is to provide a form of communication. You'll need to learn how to express your ideas not just orally and in writing, but also through your code.
\end{itemize}

Data Science is a \textbf{team} activity. Everyone working in data science brings some part of the necessary skillset, but no one person can cover all three areas alone for excellent projects.

\begin{quote}
{[}The individual who is truly expert in all three key areas (mathematics/statistics, computer science and subject-matter knowledge) is{]} a mythical beast with magical powers who's rumored to exist but is never actually seen in the wild.

\url{http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/10/battle-data-science-venn-diagrams.html}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{data-science-project-cycle}{%
\section{Data Science Project Cycle}\label{data-science-project-cycle}}

A typical data science project can be modeled as follows, which comes from the introduction to the amazing book \textbf{R for Data Science}, by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, which is a key text for this course \citep{R4DS}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/data-science-cycle} \caption{Source: R for Data Science: Introduction}\label{fig:cycle-fig}
\end{figure}

This diagram is sometimes referred to as the Krebs Cycle of Data Science. For more on the steps of a data science project, we encourage you to read the Introduction of \citet{R4DS}.

\hypertarget{data-science-and-the-431-course}{%
\section{Data Science and the 431 Course}\label{data-science-and-the-431-course}}

We'll discuss each of these elements in the 431 course, focusing at the start on understanding our data through transformation, modeling and (especially in the early stages) visualization. In 431, we learn how to get things done.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We get people working with R and R Studio and R Markdown, even if they are completely new to coding. A gentle introduction is provided at \citet{ModernDive}
\item
  We learn how to use the \texttt{tidyverse} (\url{http://www.tidyverse.org/}), an array of tools in R (mostly developed by Hadley Wickham and his colleagues at R Studio) which share an underlying philosophy to make data science faster, easier, more reproducible and more fun. A critical text for understanding the tidyverse is \citet{R4DS}. Tidyverse tools facilitate:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{importing} data into R, which can be the source of intense pain for some things, but is really quite easy 95\% of the time with the right tool.
  \item
    \textbf{tidying} data, that is, storing it in a format that includes one row per observation and one column per variable. This is harder, and more important, than you might think.
  \item
    \textbf{transforming} data, perhaps by identifying specific subgroups of interest, creating new variables based on existing ones, or calculating summaries.
  \item
    \textbf{visualizing} data to generate actual knowledge and identify questions about the data - this is an area where R really shines, and we'll start with it in class.
  \item
    \textbf{modeling} data, taking the approach that modeling is complementary to visualization, and allows us to answer questions that visualization helps us identify.
  \item
    and last, but definitely not least, \textbf{communicating} results, models and visualizations to others, in a way that is reproducible and effective.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Some programming/coding is an inevitable requirement to accomplish all of these aims. If you are leery of coding, you'll need to get past that, with the help of this course and our stellar teaching assistants. Getting started is always the most challenging part, but our experience is that most of the pain of developing these new skills evaporates by early October.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{what-the-course-is-and-isnt}{%
\section{What The Course Is and Isn't}\label{what-the-course-is-and-isnt}}

The 431 course is about \textbf{getting things done}. In developing this course, we adopt a modern approach that places data at the center of our work. Our goal is to teach you how to do truly reproducible research with modern tools. We want you to be able to collect and use data effectively to address questions of interest.

The curriculum includes more on several topics than you might expect from a standard graduate introduction to biostatistics.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  data gathering
\item
  data wrangling
\item
  exploratory data analysis and visualization
\item
  multivariate modeling
\item
  communication
\end{itemize}

It also nearly completely avoids formalism and is extremely applied - this is absolutely \textbf{not} a course in theoretical or mathematical statistics, and these Notes reflect that approach.

There's very little of the mathematical underpinnings here:

\[
f(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})}}{\sigma{\sqrt{2 \pi }}} 
\]

Instead, these notes (and the course) focus on how we get R to do the things we want to do, and how we interpret the results of our work. Our next Chapter provides a first example.

\hypertarget{part-part-a.-exploring-data}{%
\part*{Part A. Exploring Data}\label{part-part-a.-exploring-data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{part}{Part A. Exploring Data}

\hypertarget{looking-at-the-palmer-penguins}{%
\chapter{Looking at the Palmer Penguins}\label{looking-at-the-palmer-penguins}}

The data in the \texttt{palmerpenguins} package in R include size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for adult foraging Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica. The data were collected and made available by Dr.~Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program.

For more on the \texttt{palmerpenguins} package, visit \url{https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/}.

\hypertarget{package-loading-then-dealing-with-missing-data}{%
\section{Package Loading, then Dealing with Missing Data}\label{package-loading-then-dealing-with-missing-data}}

To start, let's load up the necessary R packages to manage the data and summarize it in a small table, and a plot. We've actually done this previously, but we'll repeat the steps here, because it's worth seeing what R is doing.

In this case, we'll load up five packages.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(palmerpenguins)  }\CommentTok{# source for the data set}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(janitor)         }\CommentTok{# some utilities for cleanup and simple tables}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(magrittr)        }\CommentTok{# provides us with the pipe %>% for code management}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(dplyr)           }\CommentTok{# part of the tidyverse: data management tools}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2)         }\CommentTok{# part of the tidyverse: tools for plotting data}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It's worth remembering that everything after the \texttt{\#} on each line above is just a comment for the reader, and is ignored by R. We'll see later that the loading of a single package (called \texttt{tidyverse}) gives us both the \texttt{dplyr} and \texttt{ggplot2} packages, as well as several other useful things.

Next, let's take the \texttt{penguins} data from the \texttt{palmerpenguins} package, and identify those observations which have complete data (so, no missing values) in four variables of interest. We'll store that result in a new data frame (think of this as a data set) called \texttt{new\_penguins} and then take a look at that result using the following code.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{new_penguins <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{penguins }\OperatorTok{%>%}

\hypertarget{counting-things-and-making-tables}{%
\section{Counting Things and Making Tables}\label{counting-things-and-making-tables}}

So, how many penguins are in our \texttt{new\_penguins} data? When we printed out the result, we got an answer, but (as with many things in R) there are many ways to get the same result.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{nrow}\NormalTok{(new_penguins)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 333
\end{verbatim}

How do our \texttt{new\_penguins} data break down by sex and species?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{new_penguins }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(sex, species) }\CommentTok{# tabyl comes from the janitor package}

 female     73        34     58
   male     73        34     61
\end{verbatim}

Note the strange spelling of \texttt{tabyl} here. The output is reasonably clear, but could we make that table a little prettier, and while we're at it, can we add the row and column totals to it?

Some of you may want to include a straight-line model (fit by a classical linear regression) to this plot. One way to do that in R involves the addition of a single line of code, like this:

Whenever we build a graph for ourselves, these default choices may be sufficient. But I'd like to see a prettier version if I was going to show it to someone else. So, I might use a different color for each species, and I might neaten up the theme (to get rid of the default grey background) and add a title, like this.

Now, let's build a new graph. Here, I want to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  plot the relationship between body mass and flipper length in light of both Sex and Species
\item
  increase the size of the points and add a little transparency so we can see if points overlap,
\item
  add some smooth curves to summarize the relationships between the two quantities (body mass and flipper length) within each combination of species and sex,
\item
  split the graph into two ``facets'' (one for each sex),
\item
  improve the axis labels,
\item
  improve the titles by adding a subtitle, and also adding in some code to count the penguins (rather than hard-coding in the total number.)

What can we learn from these plots and their construction? In particular,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What do these plots suggest about the center of the distribution of each quantity (body mass and flipper length) overall, and within each combination of Sex and Species?
\item
  What does the final plot suggest about the spread of the distribution of each of those quantities in each combination of Sex and Species?
\item
  What do the plots suggest about the association of body mass and flipper length across the complete set of penguins?
\item
  How does the shape and nature of this body mass - flipper length relationship change based on Sex and Species?
\item
  Do you think it would be helpful to plot a straight-line relationship (rather than a smooth curve) within each combination of Sex and Species in the final plot? Why or why not? (Also, what would we have to do to the code to accomplish this?)
\item
  How was the R code for the plot revised to accomplish each of the six ``wants'' specified above?

We'll start by visualizing some data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES. We'll display R code as we go, but we'll return to all of the key coding ideas involved later in the Notes.

\hypertarget{the-nhanes-data-collecting-a-sample}{%
\section{The NHANES data: Collecting a Sample}\label{the-nhanes-data-collecting-a-sample}}

To begin, we'll gather a random sample of 1,000 subjects participating in NHANES, and then identify several variables of interest about those subjects\footnote{For more on the NHANES data available in the NHANES package, type ?NHANES in the Console in R Studio.}. Some of the motivation for this example came from a Figure in \citet{BaumerKaplanHorton}.

We have 1000 rows (observations) and 4 columns (variables) that describe the subjects listed in the rows.

\hypertarget{age-and-height}{%
\section{Age and Height}\label{age-and-height}}

Suppose we want to visualize the relationship of Height and Age in our 1,000 NHANES observations. The best choice is likely to be a scatterplot.

Warning: Removed 37 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{431-notes_files/figure-latex/nh_dat1_heightbyage1-fig-1.pdf}

We note several interesting results here.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  As a warning, R tells us that it has ``Removed 37 rows containing missing values (geom\_point).'' Only 963 subjects plotted here, because the remaining 37 people have missing (NA) values for either Height, Age or both.
\item
  Unsurprisingly, the measured Heights of subjects grow from Age 0 to Age 20 or so, and we see that a typical Height increases rapidly across these Ages. The middle of the distribution at later Ages is pretty consistent at at a Height somewhere between 150 and 175. The units aren't specified, but we expect they must be centimeters. The Ages are clearly reported in Years.
\item
  No Age is reported over 80, and it appears that there is a large cluster of Ages at 80. This may be due to a requirement that Ages 80 and above be reported at 80 so as to help mask the identity of those individuals.\footnote{If you visit the NHANES help file with ?NHANES, you will see that subjects 80 years or older were indeed recorded as 80.}
\end{enumerate}

As in this case, we're going to build most of our visualizations using tools from the \texttt{ggplot2} package, which is part of the \texttt{tidyverse} series of packages. You'll see similar coding structures throughout this Chapter, most of which are covered as well in Chapter 3 of \citet{R4DS}.

\hypertarget{subset-of-subjects-with-known-age-and-height}{%
\section{Subset of Subjects with Known Age and Height}\label{subset-of-subjects-with-known-age-and-height}}

Before we move on, let's manipulate the data set a bit, to focus on only those subjects who have complete data on both Age and Height. This will help us avoid that warning message.

Note that the units and explanations for these variables are contained in the NHANES help file, available via typing \texttt{?NHANES} in the Console of R Studio, or by typing \texttt{NHANES} into the Search bar in R Studio's Help window.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The Distinction between \texttt{Gender} and \texttt{Sex}}{The Distinction between Gender and Sex}}\label{the-distinction-between-gender-and-sex}}

The \texttt{Gender} variable here is a mistake. These data refer to the biological status of these subjects, which is their \texttt{Sex}, and not the social construct of \texttt{Gender} which can be quite different. In our effort to avoid further confusion, we'll rename the variable \texttt{Gender} to instead more accurately describe what is actually measured here.

To do this, we can use this approach\ldots{}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Set the same seed for random sampling that we used earlier, so that we start with the original sample of 1000 people we built earlier. Draw that same sample of 1,000 people.
\item
  Filter the sample to only those people whose age is more than 20 and less than 80 years.
\item
  Select the variables we will use in the rest of this chapter:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{Age} as we've seen before, in years.
  \item
    \texttt{Height} as we've seen before, in centimeters.
  \item
    \texttt{Gender} which we'll rename as \texttt{Sex} again.
  \item
    \texttt{Pulse} = 60 second pulse rate (in beats per minute).
  \item
    \texttt{BPSysAve} = Systolic Blood Pressure, in mm Hg (and we'll rename this \texttt{SBP}).
  \item
    \texttt{SleepTrouble} = Yes means the subject has told a health professional that they had trouble sleeping.
  \item
    \texttt{PhysActive} = Yes means the subject does moderate or vigorous-intensity sports, fitness or recreational activity.
  \item
    \texttt{MaritalStatus} = one of Married, Widowed, Divorced, Separated, NeverMarried or LivePartner (living with partner.)
  \item
    \texttt{HealthGen} = self-reported rating of general health, one of Excellent, Vgood (Very Good), Good, Fair or Poor.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rename \texttt{Gender} as \texttt{Sex}, to more accurately describe what is being measured.
\item
  Omit subjects with any missingness on \emph{any} of the variables we've selected.

We can do several things to clean this up.

\begin{enumerate}

\tightlist
\item
  We'll change the color of the lines for each bar of the histogram.
\item
  We'll change the fill inside each bar to make them stand out a bit more.
\item
  We'll add a title and relabel the horizontal (x) axis to include the units of measurement.
\item
  We'll avoid the warning by selecting a number of bins (we'll use 25 here) into which we'll group the heights before drawing the histogram.

The HealthGen data are categorical, which means that summarizing them with averages isn't as appealing as looking at percentages, proportions and rates.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

This is just a small piece of the toolbox for visualizations that we'll create in this class. Many additional tools are on the way, but the main idea won't change. Using the \texttt{ggplot2} package, we can accomplish several critical tasks in creating a visualization, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Identifying (and labeling) the axes and titles
\item
  Identifying a type of \texttt{geom} to use, like a point, bar or histogram
\item
  Changing fill, color, shape, size to facilitate comparisons
\item
  Building ``small multiples'' of plots with faceting
\end{itemize}

Good data visualizations make it easy to see the data, and \texttt{ggplot2}'s tools make it relatively difficult to make a really bad graph.

\hypertarget{data-require-structure-and-context}{%
\section{Data require structure and context}\label{data-require-structure-and-context}}

\textbf{Descriptive statistics} are concerned with the presentation, organization and summary of data, as suggested in \citet{Norman-Streiner}. This includes various methods of organizing and graphing data to get an idea of what those data can tell us.

As \citet{Vittinghoff} suggest, the nature of the measurement determines how best to describe it statistically, and the main distinction is between \textbf{numerical} and \textbf{categorical} variables. Even this is a little tricky - plenty of data can have values that look like numerical values, but are just numerals serving as labels.

As \citet{BockVD} point out, the truly critical notion, of course, is that data values, no matter what kind, are useless without their contexts. The Five W's (Who, What {[}and in what units{]}, When, Where, Why, and often How) are just as useful for establishing the context of data as they are in journalism. If you can't answer Who and What, in particular, you don't have any useful information.

In general, each row of a data frame corresponds to an individual (respondent, experimental unit, record, or observation) about whom some characteristics are gathered in columns (and these characteristics may be called variables, factors or data elements.) Every column / variable should have a name that indicates \emph{what} it is measuring, and every row / observation should have a name that indicates \emph{who} is being measured.

\hypertarget{newNHANES}{%
\section{A New NHANES Adult Sample}\label{newNHANES}}

In Chapter \ref{dataviz}, we spent some time with a sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination. Now, by changing the value of the \texttt{set.seed} function which determines the starting place for the random sampling, and changing some other specifications, we'll generate a new sample describing 500 adult subjects who completed the 2011-12 version of the survey when they were between the ages of 21 and 64.

Note also that what is listed in the NHANES data frame as \texttt{Gender} should be more correctly referred to as \texttt{sex}. \texttt{Sex} is a biological feature of an individual, while \texttt{Gender} is a social construct. This is an important distinction, so I'll change the name of the variable. I'm also changing the names of three other variables, to create \texttt{Race}, \texttt{SBP} and \texttt{DBP}.

\hypertarget{quantitative-variables}{%
\section{Quantitative Variables}\label{quantitative-variables}}

Variables recorded in numbers that we use as numbers are called \textbf{quantitative}. Familiar examples include incomes, heights, weights, ages, distances, times, and counts. All quantitative variables have measurement units, which tell you how the quantitative variable was measured. Without units (like miles per hour, angstroms, yen or degrees Celsius) the values of a quantitative variable have no meaning.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It does little good to be promised a salary of 80,000 a year if you don't know whether it will be paid in Euros, dollars, yen or Estonian kroon.
\item
  You might be surprised to see someone whose age is 72 listed in a database on childhood diseases until you find out that age is measured in months.
\item
  Often just seeking the units can reveal a variable whose definition is challenging - just how do we measure ``friendliness'', or ``success,'' for example.
\item
  Quantitative variables may also be classified by whether they are \textbf{continuous} or can only take on a \textbf{discrete} set of values. Continuous data may take on any value, within a defined range. Suppose we are measuring height. While height is really continuous, our measuring stick usually only lets us measure with a certain degree of precision. If our measurements are only trustworthy to the nearest centimeter with the ruler we have, we might describe them as discrete measures. But we could always get a more precise ruler. The measurement divisions we make in moving from a continuous concept to a discrete measurement are usually fairly arbitrary. Another way to think of this, if you enjoy music, is that, as suggested in \citet{Norman-Streiner}, a piano is a \emph{discrete} instrument, but a violin is a \emph{continuous} one, enabling finer distinctions between notes than the piano is capable of making. Sometimes the distinction between continuous and discrete is important, but usually, it's not.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \texttt{nh\_adults} data includes several quantitative variables, specifically \texttt{Age}, \texttt{BMI}, \texttt{SBP}, \texttt{DBP} and \texttt{Pulse}.
  \item
    We know these are quantitative because they have units: \texttt{Age} in years, \texttt{BMI} in kg/m\textsuperscript{2}, the \texttt{BP} measurements in mm Hg, and \texttt{Pulse} in beats per minute.
  \item
    Depending on the context, we would likely treat most of these as \emph{discrete} given that are measurements are fairly crude (this is certainly true for \texttt{Age}, measured in years) although BMI is probably \emph{continuous} in most settings, even though it is a function of two other measures (\texttt{Height} and \texttt{Weight}) which are rounded off to integer numbers of centimeters and kilograms, respectively.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  It is also possible to separate out quantitative variables into \textbf{ratio} variables or \textbf{interval} variables. An interval variable has equal distances between values, but the zero point is arbitrary. A ratio variable has equal intervals between values, and a meaningful zero point. For example, weight is an example of a ratio variable, while IQ is an example of an interval variable. We all know what zero weight is. An intelligence score like IQ is a different matter. We say that the average IQ is 100, but that's only by convention. We could just as easily have decided to add 400 to every IQ value and make the average 500 instead. Because IQ's intervals are equal, the difference between and IQ of 70 and an IQ of 80 is the same as the difference between 120 and 130. However, an IQ of 100 is not twice as high as an IQ of 50. The point is that if the zero point is artificial and moveable, then the differences between numbers are meaningful but the ratios between them are not. On the other hand, most lab test values are ratio variables, as are physical characteristics like height and weight. A person who weighs 100 kg is twice as heavy as one who weighs 50 kg; even when we convert kg to pounds, this is still true. For the most part, we can treat and analyze interval or ratio variables the same way.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Each of the quantitative variables in our \texttt{nh\_adults} data can be thought of as ratio variables.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Quantitative variables lend themselves to many of the summaries we will discuss, like means, quantiles, and our various measures of spread, like the standard deviation or inter-quartile range. They also have at least a chance to follow the Normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{a-look-at-bmi-body-mass-index}{%
\subsection{A look at BMI (Body-Mass Index)}\label{a-look-at-bmi-body-mass-index}}

The definition of BMI (\emph{body-mass index}) for adult subjects (which is expressed in units of kg/m\textsuperscript{2}) is:

\[
\mbox{Body Mass Index} = \frac{\mbox{weight in kg}}{(\mbox{height in meters})^2} = 703 \times \frac{\mbox{weight in pounds}}{(\mbox{height in inches})^2}
\]

\begin{quote}
{[}BMI is essentially{]} \ldots{} a measure of a person's \emph{thinness} or \emph{thickness}\ldots{} BMI was designed for use as a simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive) populations, with an average body composition. For these individuals, the current value recommendations are as follow: a BMI from 18.5 up to 25 may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is underweight, a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is overweight, and a number from 30 upwards suggests the person is obese.

\end{quote}

\hypertarget{qualitative-categorical-variables}{%
\section{Qualitative (Categorical) Variables}\label{qualitative-categorical-variables}}

\textbf{Qualitative} or categorical variables consist of names of categories. These names may be numerical, but the numbers (or names) are simply codes to identify the groups or categories into which the individuals are divided. Categorical variables with two categories, like yes or no, up or down, or, more generally, 1 and 0, are called \textbf{binary} variables. Those with more than two-categories are sometimes called \textbf{multi-categorical} variables.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When the categories included in a variable are merely names, and come in no particular order, we sometimes call them \textbf{nominal} variables. The most important summary of such a variable is usually a table of frequencies, and the mode becomes an important single summary, while the mean and median are essentially useless.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the nh\_adults data, \texttt{Race} is a nominal variable with multiple unordered categories. So is \texttt{MaritalStatus}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The alternative categorical variable (where order matters) is called \textbf{ordinal}, and includes variables that are sometimes thought of as falling right in between quantitative and qualitative variables.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Examples of ordinal multi-categorical variables in the \texttt{nh\_adults} data include the Education and HealthGen variables.
  \item
    Answers to questions like ``How is your overall physical health?'' with available responses Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor, which are often coded as 1-5, certainly provide a perceived \emph{order}, but a group of people with average health status 4 (Very Good) is not necessarily twice as healthy as a group with average health status of 2 (Fair).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Sometimes we treat the values from ordinal variables as sufficiently scaled to permit us to use quantitative approaches like means, quantiles, and standard deviations to summarize and model the results, and at other times, we'll treat ordinal variables as if they were nominal, with tables and percentages our primary tools.
\item
  Note that all binary variables may be treated as ordinal, or nominal.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Binary variables in the \texttt{nh\_adults} data include \texttt{Sex}, \texttt{PhysActive}, \texttt{Smoke100}, \texttt{SleepTrouble}. Each can be thought of as either ordinal or nominal.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Lots of variables may be treated as either quantitative or qualitative, depending on how we use them. For instance, we usually think of age as a quantitative variable, but if we simply use age to make the distinction between ``child'' and ``adult'' then we are using it to describe categorical information. Just because your variable's values are numbers, don't assume that the information provided is quantitative.

\hypertarget{summarizing_quantities}{%

This basic summary includes a set of five \textbf{quantiles}\footnote{The quantiles (sometimes referred to as percentiles) can also be summarised with a boxplot.}, plus the sample's \textbf{mean}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{Min.} = the \textbf{minimum} value for each variable, so, for example, the youngest subject's Age was 21.
\item
  \texttt{1st\ Qu.} = the \textbf{first quartile} (25\textsuperscript{th} percentile) for each variable - for example, 25\% of the subjects were Age 31 or younger.
\item
  \texttt{Median} = the \textbf{median} (50\textsuperscript{th} percentile) - half of the subjects were Age 42 or younger.
\item
  \texttt{Mean} = the \textbf{mean}, usually what one means by an \emph{average} - the sum of the Ages divided by 500 is 41.9,
\item
  \texttt{3rd\ Qu.} = the \textbf{third quartile} (75\textsuperscript{th} percentile) - 25\% of the subjects were Age 53 or older.
\item
  \texttt{Max.} = the \textbf{maximum} value for each variable, so the oldest subject was Age 64.
\end{itemize}

The summary also specifies the number of missing values for each variable. Here, we are missing 5 of the BMI values, for example.

\subsection{The Mean and The Median}\label{the-mean-and-the-median}}

The \textbf{mean} and \textbf{median} are the most commonly used measures of the center of a distribution for a quantitative variable. The median is the more generally useful value, as it is relevant even if the data have a shape that is not symmetric. We might also collect the \textbf{sum} of the observations, and the \textbf{count} of the number of observations, usually symbolized with \emph{n}.

For variables without missing values, like \texttt{Age}, this is pretty straightforward.

  <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <int>
1   500  41.9     42 20953
\end{verbatim}

And again, the Mean is just the Sum (20953), divided by the number of non-missing values of Age (500), or 41.906.

The Median is the middle value when the data are sorted in order. When we have an odd number of values, this is sufficient. When we have an even number, as in this case, we take the mean of the two middle values. We could sort and list all 500 Ages, if we wanted to do so.

But this data set figures we don't want to output more than 10 observations to a table like this.

This fails because we have some missing values in the Pulse data.

\section{Measuring the Spread of a Distribution}\label{measuring-the-spread-of-a-distribution}}

Statistics is all about variation, so spread or dispersion is an important fundamental concept in statistics. Measures of spread like the inter-quartile range and range (maximum - minimum) can help us understand and compare data sets. If the values in the data are close to the center, the spread will be small. If many of the values in the data are scattered far away from the center, the spread will be large.

The IQR is always a reasonable summary of spread, just as the median is always a reasonable summary of the center of a distribution. Yet, most people are inclined to summarise a batch of data using two numbers: the \textbf{mean} and the \textbf{standard deviation}. This is really only a sensible thing to do if you are willing to assume the data follow a Normal distribution: a bell-shaped, symmetric distribution without substantial outliers.

But \textbf{most data do not (even approximately) follow a Normal distribution}. Summarizing by the median and quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles) is much more robust, explaining R's emphasis on them.

\hypertarget{defining-the-variance-and-standard-deviation}{%
\subsection{Defining the Variance and Standard Deviation}\label{defining-the-variance-and-standard-deviation}}

\citet{BockVD} have lots of useful thoughts here, which are lightly edited here.

In thinking about spread, we might consider how far each data value is from the mean. Such a difference is called a \emph{deviation}. We could just average the deviations, but the positive and negative differences always cancel out, leaving an average deviation of zero, so that's not helpful. Instead, we \emph{square} each deviation to obtain non-negative values, and to emphasize larger differences. When we add up these squared deviations and find their mean (almost), this yields the \textbf{variance}.

\[
\mbox{Variance} = s^2 = \frac{\Sigma (y - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}
\]

Why almost? It would be the mean of the squared deviations only if we divided the sum by \(n\), but instead we divide by \(n-1\) because doing so produces an estimate of the true (population) variance that is \emph{unbiased}\footnote{When we divide by n-1 as we calculate the sample variance, the average of the sample variances for all possible samples is equal to the population variance. If we instead divided by n, the average sample variance across all possible samples would be a little smaller than the population variance.}. If you're looking for a more intuitive explanation, \href{http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/3931/intuitive-explanation-for-dividing-by-n-1-when-calculating-standard-deviation}{this Stack Exchange link} awaits your attention.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To return to the original units of measurement, we take the square root of \(s^2\), and instead work with \(s\), the \textbf{standard deviation}, also abbreviated SD.
\end{itemize}

\[
\mbox{Standard Deviation} = s = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma (y - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}}
\]

\hypertarget{interpreting-the-sd-when-the-data-are-normally-distributed}{%
\subsection{Interpreting the SD when the data are Normally distributed}\label{interpreting-the-sd-when-the-data-are-normally-distributed}}

For a set of measurements that follow a Normal distribution, the interval:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mean \(\pm\) Standard Deviation contains approximately 68\% of the measurements;
\item
  Mean \(\pm\) 2(Standard Deviation) contains approximately 95\% of the measurements;
\item
  Mean \(\pm\) 3(Standard Deviation) contains approximately all (99.7\%) of the measurements.
\end{itemize}

We often refer to the population or process mean of a distribution with \(\mu\) and the standard deviation with \(\sigma\), leading to the Figure below.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/Empirical_Rule} \caption{The Normal Distribution and the Empirical Rule}\label{fig:EmpRule-fig1}
\end{figure}

But if the data are not from an approximately Normal distribution, then this Empirical Rule is less helpful.

\subsection{Chebyshev's Inequality: One Interpretation of the Standard Deviation}\label{chebyshevs-inequality-one-interpretation-of-the-standard-deviation}}

Chebyshev's Inequality tells us that for any distribution, regardless of its relationship to a Normal distribution, no more than 1/k\textsuperscript{2} of the distribution's values can lie more than k standard deviations from the mean. This implies, for instance, that for \textbf{any} distribution, at least 75\% of the values must lie within two standard deviations of the mean, and at least 89\% must lie within three standard deviations of the mean.

Again, most data sets do not follow a Normal distribution. We'll return to this notion soon. But first, let's try to draw some pictures that let us get a better understanding of the distribution of our data.

\hypertarget{measuring-the-shape-of-a-distribution}{%
\section{Measuring the Shape of a Distribution}\label{measuring-the-shape-of-a-distribution}}

When considering the shape of a distribution, one is often interested in three key points.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The number of modes in the distribution, which I always assess through plotting the data.
\item
  The \textbf{skewness}, or symmetry that is present, which I typically assess by looking at a plot of the distribution of the data, but if required to, will summarise with a non-parametric measure of \textbf{skewness}.
\item
  The \textbf{kurtosis}, or heavy-tailedness (outlier-proneness) that is present, usually in comparison to a Normal distribution. Again, this is something I nearly inevitably assess graphically, but there are measures.
\end{itemize}

A Normal distribution has a single mode, is symmetric and, naturally, is neither heavy-tailed nor light-tailed as compared to a Normal distribution (we call this mesokurtic).

\hypertarget{multimodal-vs.-unimodal-distributions}{%
\subsection{Multimodal vs.~Unimodal distributions}\label{multimodal-vs.-unimodal-distributions}}

A unimodal distribution, on some level, is straightforward. It is a distribution with a single mode, or ``peak'' in the distribution. Such a distribution may be skewed or symmetric, light-tailed or heavy-tailed. We usually describe as multimodal distributions like the two on the right below, which have multiple local maxima, even though they have just a single global maximum peak.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/modality} \caption{Unimodal and Multimodal Sketches}\label{fig:modality-fig}
\end{figure}

Truly multimodal distributions are usually described that way in terms of shape. For unimodal distributions, skewness and kurtosis become useful ideas.

\hypertarget{skew}{%
\subsection{Skew}\label{skew}}

Whether or not a distribution is approximately symmetric is an important consideration in describing its shape. Graphical assessments are always most useful in this setting, particularly for unimodal data. My favorite measure of skew, or skewness if the data have a single mode, is:

\[
skew_1 = \frac{\mbox{mean} - \mbox{median}}{\mbox{standard deviation}}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Symmetric distributions generally show values of \(skew_1\) near zero. If the distribution is actually symmetric, the mean should be equal to the median.
\item
  Distributions with \(skew_1\) values above 0.2 in absolute value generally indicate meaningful skew.
\item
  Positive skew (mean \textgreater{} median if the data are unimodal) is also referred to as \emph{right skew}.
\item
  Negative skew (mean \textless{} median if the data are unimodal) is referred to as \emph{left skew}.
\end{itemize}

When we have a unimodal distribution that is symmetric, we will often be interested in the behavior of the tails of the distribution, as compared to a Normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. High values of kurtosis measures (and there are several) indicate data which has extreme outliers, or is heavy-tailed.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A mesokurtic distribution has similar tail behavior to what we would expect from a Normal distribution.
\item
  A leptokurtic distribution is a thinner distribution, with lighter tails (fewer observations far from the center) than we'd expect from a Normal distribution.
\item
  A platykurtic distribution is a flatter distribution, with heavier tails (more observations far from the center) than we'd expect from a Normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

Graphical tools are in most cases the best way to identify issues related to kurtosis.

The somewhat unusual structure of \texttt{favstats} (complete with an easy to forget \texttt{\textasciitilde{}}) is actually helpful. It allows you to look at some interesting grouping approaches, like this:

The additional statistics presented here are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{trimmed} = a trimmed mean (by default in this function, this removes the top and bottom 10\% from the data, then computes the mean of the remaining values - the middle 80\% of the full data set.)
\item
  \texttt{mad} = the median absolute deviation (from the median), which can be used in a manner similar to the standard deviation or IQR to measure spread.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the data are \(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n\), then the \texttt{mad} is defined as \(median(|Y_i - median(Y_i)|)\).
  \item
    To find the \texttt{mad} for a set of numbers, find the median, subtract the median from each value and find the absolute value of that difference, and then find the median of those absolute differences.
  \item
    For non-normal data with a skewed shape but tails well approximated by the Normal, the \texttt{mad} is likely to be a better (more robust) estimate of the spread than is the standard deviation.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  a measure of \texttt{skew}, which refers to how much asymmetry is present in the shape of the distribution. The measure is not the same as the \emph{nonparametric skew} measure that we will usually prefer. The {[}Wikipedia page on skewness{]}{[}\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness}{]} is very detailed.
\item
  a measure of \texttt{kurtosis}, which refers to how outlier-prone, or heavy-tailed the shape of the distribution is, mainly as compared to a Normal distribution.
\item
  \texttt{se} = the standard error of the sample mean, equal to the sample sd divided by the square root of the sample size.

The \texttt{Hmisc} package's version of \texttt{describe} for a distribution of data presents three new ideas, in addition to a more comprehensive list of quartiles (the 5\textsuperscript{th}, 10\textsuperscript{th}, 25\textsuperscript{th}, 50\textsuperscript{th}, 75\textsuperscript{th}, 90\textsuperscript{th} and 95\textsuperscript{th} are shown) and the lowest and highest few observations. These are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{distinct} - the number of different values observed in the data.
\item
  \texttt{Info} - a measure of how ``continuous'' the variable is, related to how many ``ties'' there are in the data, with Info taking a higher value (closer to its maximum of one) if the data are more continuous.
\item
  \texttt{Gmd} - the Gini mean difference - a robust measure of spread that is calculated as the mean absolute difference between any pairs of observations. Larger values of Gmd indicate more spread-out distributions.
\end{itemize}

Note that this isn't really for Word documents.

The \href{http://naniar.njtierney.com/}{\texttt{naniar} package} is helpful for wrangling and visualizing missing values, and checking imputations.

\href{https://boxuancui.github.io/DataExplorer/}{\texttt{DataExplorer}} can be used for more automated exploratory data analyses (and some people also like \href{https://github.com/ropensci/skimr}{\texttt{skimr}}) and \href{http://visdat.njtierney.com/}{\texttt{visdat}}, as well.

Summarizing categorical variables numerically is mostly about building tables, and calculating percentages or proportions. We'll save our discussion of modeling categorical data for later. Recall that in the \texttt{nh\_adults} data set we built in Section \ref{newNHANES} we had the following categorical variables. The number of levels indicates the number of possible categories for each categorical variable.

To find the mode for variables with lots of categories (so that the \texttt{summary} may not be sufficient), we usually tabulate the data, and then sort by the counts of the numbers of observations, as we did with discrete quantitative variables.

\section{Cross-Tabulations}\label{cross-tabulations}}

It is very common for us to want to describe the association of one categorical variable with another. For instance, is there a relationship between Education and SleepTrouble in these data?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nh_adults }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(Education, SleepTrouble) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_totals}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{where =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"row"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"col"}\NormalTok{)) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
      Education  No Yes Total
      8th Grade  18   6    24
 9 - 11th Grade  45  15    60
    High School  62  19    81
   Some College 118  35   153
   College Grad 137  45   182
          Total 380 120   500
\end{verbatim}

Note the use of \texttt{adorn\_totals} to get the marginal counts, and how we specify that we want both the row and column totals. We can add a title for the columns with\ldots{}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nh_adults }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(Education, SleepTrouble) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_totals}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{where =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"row"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"col"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_title}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{placement =} \StringTok{"combined"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 Education/SleepTrouble  No Yes Total
              8th Grade  18   6    24
         9 - 11th Grade  45  15    60
            High School  62  19    81
           Some College 118  35   153
           College Grad 137  45   182
                  Total 380 120   500
\end{verbatim}

Often, we'll want to show percentages in a cross-tabulation like this. To get row percentages so that we can directly see the probability of \texttt{SleepTrouble\ =\ Yes} for each level of \texttt{Education}, we can use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nh_adults }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(Education, SleepTrouble) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_totals}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{where =} \StringTok{"row"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_percentages}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{denominator =} \StringTok{"row"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_pct_formatting}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_title}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{placement =} \StringTok{"combined"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 Education/SleepTrouble    No   Yes
              8th Grade 75.0% 25.0%
         9 - 11th Grade 75.0% 25.0%
            High School 76.5% 23.5%
           Some College 77.1% 22.9%
           College Grad 75.3% 24.7%
                  Total 76.0% 24.0%
\end{verbatim}

If we want to compare the distribution of \texttt{Education} between the two levels of \texttt{SleepTrouble} with column percentages, we can use the following\ldots{}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nh_adults }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(Education, SleepTrouble) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_totals}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{where =} \StringTok{"col"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_percentages}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{denominator =} \StringTok{"col"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_pct_formatting}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_title}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{placement =} \StringTok{"combined"}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 Education/SleepTrouble    No   Yes Total
              8th Grade  4.7%  5.0%  4.8%
         9 - 11th Grade 11.8% 12.5% 12.0%
            High School 16.3% 15.8% 16.2%
           Some College 31.1% 29.2% 30.6%
           College Grad 36.1% 37.5% 36.4%
\end{verbatim}

If we want overall percentages in the cells of the table, so that the total across all combinations of \texttt{Education} and \texttt{SleepTrouble} is 100\%, we can use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nh_adults }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(Education, SleepTrouble) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_totals}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{where =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"row"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"col"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_percentages}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{denominator =} \StringTok{"all"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_pct_formatting}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_title}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{placement =} \StringTok{"combined"}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 Education/SleepTrouble    No   Yes  Total
              8th Grade  3.6%  1.2%   4.8%
         9 - 11th Grade  9.0%  3.0%  12.0%
            High School 12.4%  3.8%  16.2%
           Some College 23.6%  7.0%  30.6%
           College Grad 27.4%  9.0%  36.4%
                  Total 76.0% 24.0% 100.0%
\end{verbatim}

Another common approach is to include both counts and percentages in a cross-tabulation. Let's look at the breakdown of \texttt{HealthGen} by \texttt{MaritalStatus}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nh_adults }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(MaritalStatus, HealthGen) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_totals}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{where =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"row"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_percentages}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{denominator =} \StringTok{"row"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_pct_formatting}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_ns}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{position =} \StringTok{"front"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_title}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{placement =} \StringTok{"combined"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\NormalTok{knitr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{kable}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l|l}
\hline
MaritalStatus/HealthGen & Excellent & Vgood & Good & Fair & Poor & NA\_\\
\hline
Divorced & 7 (13.7\%) & 14 (27.5\%) & 20 (39.2\%) & 5  (9.8\%) & 2  (3.9\%) & 3  (5.9\%)\\
\hline

\hline

\hline
NeverMarried & 14 (12.5\%) & 31 (27.7\%) & 43 (38.4\%) & 13 (11.6\%) & 3  (2.7\%) & 8  (7.1\%)\\
\hline
Separated & 4 (25.0\%) & 4 (25.0\%) & 1  (6.2\%) & 4 (25.0\%) & 1  (6.2\%) & 2 (12.5\%)\\
\hline
Widowed & 1  (9.1\%) & 3 (27.3\%) & 2 (18.2\%) & 1  (9.1\%) & 3 (27.3\%) & 1  (9.1\%)\\
\hline
Total & 50 (10.0\%) & 154 (30.8\%) & 184 (36.8\%) & 49  (9.8\%) & 14  (2.8\%) & 49  (9.8\%)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

What if we wanted to ignore the missing \texttt{HealthGen} values? Most often, I filter down to the complete observations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nh_adults }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{complete.cases}\NormalTok{(MaritalStatus, HealthGen)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}

For more on working with \texttt{tabyls}, see the vignette in the \texttt{janitor} package. There you'll find a complete list of all of the \texttt{adorn} functions, for example.

Here's another approach, to look at the cross-classification of Race and HealthGen:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{xtabs}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Race }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{HealthGen, }\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ nh_adults)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{cross-classifying-three-categorical-variables}{%
\subsection{Cross-Classifying Three Categorical Variables}\label{cross-classifying-three-categorical-variables}}

Suppose we are interested in \texttt{Smoke100} and its relationship to \texttt{PhysActive} and \texttt{SleepTrouble}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nh_adults }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(Smoke100, PhysActive, SleepTrouble) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{adorn_title}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{placement =} \StringTok{"top"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
$No
          PhysActive    
 Smoke100         No Yes
       No         99 142
      Yes         62  77

$Yes
          PhysActive    
 Smoke100         No Yes
       No         21  35
      Yes         33  31
\end{verbatim}

The result here is a tabyl of \texttt{Smoke100} (rows) by \texttt{PhysActive} (columns), split into a list by \texttt{SleepTrouble}. Another approach to get the same table is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{xtabs}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Smoke100 }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{PhysActive }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{SleepTrouble, }\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ nh_adults)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
, , SleepTrouble = No

        PhysActive
Smoke100  No Yes
     No   99 142
     Yes  62  77

, , SleepTrouble = Yes

        PhysActive
Smoke100  No Yes
     No   21  35
     Yes  33  31
\end{verbatim}

We can also build a \textbf{flat} version of this table, as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ftable}\NormalTok{(Smoke100 }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{PhysActive }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{SleepTrouble, }\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ nh_adults)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
                        Smoke100  No Yes
PhysActive SleepTrouble                 
No         No                     99  62
           Yes                    21  33
Yes        No                    142  77

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Alabama First!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Size places - put the largest first. We often look most carefully at the top.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Order time from the past to the future to help the viewer.
\item
  If there is a clear predictor-outcome relationship, put the predictors in the rows and the outcomes in the columns.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{round---a-lot}{%
\subsection{Round - a lot!}\label{round---a-lot}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Humans cannot understand more than two digits very easily.
\item
  We almost never care about accuracy of more than two digits.
\item
  We can almost never justify more than two digits of accuracy statistically.
\item
  It's also helpful to remember that we are almost invariably publishing progress to date, rather than a truly final answer.
\end{itemize}

Suppose, for instance, we report a correlation coefficient of 0.25. How many observations do you think you would need to justify such a choice?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To report 0.25 meaningfully, we want to be sure that the second digit isn't 4 or 6.
\item
  That requires a standard error less than 0.005
\item
  The \emph{standard error} of any statistic is proportional to 1 over the square root of the sample size, \emph{n}.
\end{itemize}

So \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\) \textasciitilde{} 0.005, but that means \(\sqrt{n} = \frac{1}{0.005} = 200\). If \(\sqrt{n} = 200\), then \emph{n} = (200)\textsuperscript{2} = 40,000.

Do we usually have 40,000 observations?

\hypertarget{all-is-different-and-important}{%
\subsection{ALL is different and important}\label{all-is-different-and-important}}

Summaries of rows and columns provide a measure of what is typical or usual. Sometimes a sum is helpful, at other times, consider presenting a median or other summary. The ALL category, as \citet{HW_VisualRevelations} suggests, should be both visually different from the individual entries and set spatially apart.

On the whole, it's \emph{far} easier to fall into a good graph in R (at least if you have some ggplot2 skills) than to produce a good table.

\hypertarget{NYFS-Study}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey (\texttt{nnyfs})}{NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey (nnyfs)}}\label{NYFS-Study}}

The \texttt{nnyfs.csv} and the \texttt{nnyfs.Rds} data files were built by Professor Love using data from the \href{http://www.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nnyfs.htm}{2012 National Youth Fitness Survey}.

\begin{quote}
The NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey (NNYFS) was conducted in 2012 to collect data on physical activity and fitness levels in order to provide an evaluation of the health and fitness of children in the U.S. ages 3 to 15. The NNYFS collected data on physical activity and fitness levels of our youth through interviews and fitness tests.
\end{quote}

In the \texttt{nnyfs} data file (either \texttt{.csv} or \texttt{.Rds}), I'm only providing a modest fraction of the available information. More on the NNYFS (including information I'm not using) is available at \url{https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/nnyfs12.aspx}.

The data elements I'm using fall into four main groups, or components:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/nnyfsdata.aspx?Component=Demographics}{Demographics}
\item
  \href{https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/nnyfsdata.aspx?Component=Dietary}{Dietary}
\item
  \href{http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/nnyfsdata.aspx?Component=Examination}{Examination} and
\item
  \href{https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/nnyfsdata.aspx?Component=Questionnaire}{Questionnaire}
\end{itemize}

What I did was merge a few elements from each of the available components of the NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey, reformulated (and in some cases simplified) some variables, and restricted the sample to kids who had completed elements of each of the four components.

Tibbles are a modern reimagining of the main way in which people have stored data in R, called a data frame. Tibbles were developed to keep what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. We can learn something about the structure of the tibble from such functions as \texttt{str} or \texttt{glimpse}.

There are a lot of variables here. Let's run through the first few in a little detail.

\hypertarget{seqn}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{SEQN}}{SEQN}}\label{seqn}}

The first variable, \texttt{SEQN} is just a (numerical) identifying code attributable to a given subject of the survey. This is \emph{nominal} data, which will be of little interest down the line. On some occasions, as in this case, the ID numbers are sequential, in the sense that subject 71919 was included in the data base after subject 71918, but this fact isn't particularly interesting here, because the protocol remained unchanged throughout the study.

\hypertarget{sex}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{sex}}{sex}}\label{sex}}

The second variable, \texttt{sex}, is listed as a character variable (R uses \textbf{factor} and \textbf{character} to refer to categorical, especially non-numeric information). Here, as we can see below, we have two levels, \emph{Female} and \emph{Male}.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
    sex    n percent
 Female  760   50.1%
   Male  758   49.9%
  Total 1518  100.0%
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{age_child}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{age\_child}}{age\_child}}\label{age_child}}

The third variable, \texttt{age\_child}, is the age of the child at the time of their screening to be in the study, measured in years. Note that age is a continuous concept, but the measure used here (number of full years alive) is a common discrete approach to measurement. Age, of course, has a meaningful zero point, so this can be thought of as a ratio variable; a child who is 6 is half as old as one who is 12. We can tabulate the observed values, since there are only a dozen or so.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nnyfs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(age_child) }\OperatorTok{%>%}

         4 112    7.4%

         6 129    8.5%
         7 123    8.1%
         8 112    7.4%
         9  99    6.5%
        10 124    8.2%
        11 111    7.3%
        12 137    9.0%
        13 119    7.8%
        14 130    8.6%
        15  98    6.5%
\end{verbatim}

At the time of initial screening, these children should have been between 3 and 15 years of age, so things look reasonable. Since this is a meaningful quantitative variable, we may be interested in a more descriptive summary.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

 Median : 9.000  
 Mean   : 9.033  
 3rd Qu.:12.000  
 Max.   :15.000  
\end{verbatim}

These six numbers provide a nice, if incomplete, look at the ages.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{Min.} = the minimum, or youngest age at the examination was 3 years old.
\item
  \texttt{1st\ Qu.} = the first quartile (25th percentile) of the ages was 6. This means that 25 percent of the subjects were age 6 or less.
\item
  \texttt{Median} = the second quartile (50th percentile) of the ages was 9. This is often used to describe the center of the data. Half of the subjects were age 9 or less.
\item
  \texttt{3rd\ Qu.} = the third quartile (75th percentile) of the ages was 12
\item
  \texttt{Max.} = the maximum, or oldest age at the examination was 15 years.
\end{itemize}

We could get the standard deviation and a count of missing and non-missing observations with \texttt{favstats} from the \texttt{mosaic} package.

\end{tabular}

\hypertarget{race_eth}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{race\_eth}}{race\_eth}}\label{race_eth}}

The fourth variable in the data set is \texttt{race\_eth}, which is a multi-categorical variable describing the child's race and ethnicity.

\hypertarget{income_pov}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{income\_pov}}{income\_pov}}\label{income_pov}}

Skipping down a bit, let's look at the family income as a multiple of the poverty level. Here's the summary.

 3rd Qu.:3.520  
 Max.   :5.000  
 NA's   :89     
\end{verbatim}

We see there is some missing data here. Let's ignore that for the moment and concentrate on interpreting the results for the children with actual data. We should start with a picture.

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{431-notes_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-29-1.pdf}

The histogram shows us that the values are truncated at 5, so that children whose actual family income is above 5 times the poverty line are listed as 5. We also see a message reminding us that some of the data are missing for this variable.

Is there a relationship between \texttt{income\_pov} and \texttt{race\_eth} in these data?

\hypertarget{bmi}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{bmi}}{bmi}}\label{bmi}}

Moving into the body measurement data, \texttt{bmi} is the body-mass index of the child. The BMI is a person's weight in kilograms divided by his or her height in meters squared. Symbolically, BMI = weight in kg / (height in m)\textsuperscript{2}. This is a continuous concept, measured to as many decimal places as you like, and it has a meaningful zero point, so it's a ratio variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nnyfs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(bmi) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{()}

 3rd Qu.:21.90  
 Max.   :48.30  
 NA's   :4      
\end{verbatim}

Why would a table of these BMI values not be a great idea, for these data? A hint is that R represents this variable as \texttt{num} or numeric in its depiction of the data structure, and this implies that R has some decimal values stored. Here, I'll use the \texttt{head()} function and the \texttt{tail()} function to show the first few and the last few values of what would prove to be a very long table of \texttt{bmi} values.

\hypertarget{bmi_cat}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{bmi\_cat}}{bmi\_cat}}\label{bmi_cat}}

Next I'll look at the \texttt{bmi\_cat} information. This is a four-category ordinal variable, which divides the sample according to BMI into four groups. The BMI categories use sex-specific 2000 BMI-for-age (in months) growth charts prepared by the Centers for Disease Control for the US. We can get the breakdown from a table of the variable's values.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nnyfs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{tabyl}\NormalTok{(bmi_cat) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{adorn_pct_formatting}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
       bmi_cat   n percent valid_percent
 1_Underweight  41    2.7%          2.7%
      2_Normal 920   60.6%         60.8%
  3_Overweight 258   17.0%         17.0%
       4_Obese 295   19.4%         19.5%
          <NA>   4    0.3%             -
\end{verbatim}

In terms of percentiles by age and sex from the growth charts, the meanings of the categories are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Underweight (BMI \textless{} 5th percentile)
\item
  Normal weight (BMI 5th to \textless{} 85th percentile)
\item
  Overweight (BMI 85th to \textless{} 95th percentile)
\item
  Obese (BMI \(\geq\) 95th percentile)
\end{itemize}

Note how I've used labels in the \texttt{bmi\_cat} variable that include a number at the start so that the table results are sorted in a rational way. R sorts tables alphabetically, in general. We'll use the \texttt{forcats} package to work with categorical variables that we store as \emph{factors} eventually, but for now, we'll keep things relatively simple.

Note that the \texttt{bmi\_cat} data don't completely separate out the raw \texttt{bmi} data, because the calculation of percentiles requires different tables for each combination of \texttt{age} and \texttt{sex}.

The \textbf{five number summary} is most famous when used to form a box plot - it's the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile and maximum. For numerical and integer variables, the \texttt{summary} function produces the five number summary, plus the mean, and a count of any missing values (NA's).

As an alternative, we can use the \texttt{\$} notation to indicate the variable we wish to study inside a data set, and we can use the \texttt{fivenum} function to get the five numbers used in developing a box plot. We'll focus for a little while on the number of kilocalories consumed by each child, according to the dietary recall questionnaire. That's the \texttt{energy} variable.

  As mentioned in \ref{rangeandiqr}, the \textbf{inter-quartile range}, or IQR, is sometimes used as a competitor for the standard deviation. It's the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile.

If we're focusing on a single variable, the \texttt{favstats} function in the \texttt{mosaic} package can be very helpful. Rather than calling up the entire \texttt{mosaic} library here, I'll just specify the function within the library.

\begin{Shaded}

This adds three useful results to the base summary - the standard deviation, the sample size and the number of missing observations.

\hypertarget{the-histogram}{%

As we saw in \ref{dataviz}, obtaining a basic \textbf{histogram} of, for example, the energy (kilocalories consumed) in the \texttt{nnyfs} data is pretty straightforward.

\hypertarget{freedman-diaconis-rule-to-select-bin-width}{%
\subsection{Freedman-Diaconis Rule to select bin width}\label{freedman-diaconis-rule-to-select-bin-width}}

If we like, we can suggest a particular number of cells for the histogram, instead of accepting the defaults. In this case, we have \(n\) = 1518 observations. The \textbf{Freedman-Diaconis rule} can be helpful here. That rule suggests that we set the bin-width to

\[
h = \frac{2*IQR}{n^{1/3}}
\]

so that the number of bins is equal to the range of the data set (maximum - minimum) divided by \(h\).

For the \texttt{energy} data in the \texttt{nnyfs} tibble, we have

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  IQR of 938.5, \(n\) = 1518 and range = 5008
\item
  Thus, by the Freedman-Diaconis rule, the optimal binwidth \(h\) is 163.3203676, or, realistically, 163.
\item
  And so the number of bins would be 30.6636586, or, realistically 31.
\end{itemize}

Here, we'll draw the graph again, using the Freedman-Diaconis rule to identify the number of bins, and also play around a bit with the fill and color of the bars.

Let's improve the axis labels, add a title, and fill in the bars with a distinctive blue and use a black outline around each bar. I'll just use 25 bars, because I like how that looks in this case, and optimizing the number of bins is rarely important.

\hypertarget{a-note-on-colors}{%
\subsection{A Note on Colors}\label{a-note-on-colors}}

The simplest way to specify a color is with its name, enclosed in parentheses. My favorite list of R colors is \url{http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf}. In a pinch, you can usually find it by googling \textbf{Colors in R}. You can also type \texttt{colors()} in the R console to obtain a list of the names of the same 657 colors.

When using colors to make comparisons, you may be interested in using a scale that has some nice properties. The \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html}{viridis package vignette} describes four color scales (viridis, magma, plasma and inferno) that are designed to be colorful, robust to colorblindness and gray scale printing, and perceptually uniform, which means (as the package authors describe it) that values close to each other have similar-appearing colors and values far away from each other have more different-appearing colors, consistently across the range of values. We can apply these colors with special functions within \texttt{ggplot}.

Here's a comparison of several histograms, looking at \texttt{energy} consumed as a function of whether yesterday was typical in terms of food consumption.

\item
  A probability density function is a function of a continuous variable, x, that represents the probability of x falling within a given range. Specifically, the integral over the interval (a,b) of the density function gives the probability that the value of x is within (a,b).
\item

\hypertarget{about-the-boxplot}{%
\subsection{About the Boxplot}\label{about-the-boxplot}}

The boxplot is another John Tukey invention.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R draws the box (here in yellow) so that its edges of the box fall at the 25\textsuperscript{th} and 75\textsuperscript{th} percentiles of the data, and the thick line inside the box falls at the median (50\textsuperscript{th} percentile).
\item
  The whiskers then extend out to the largest and smallest values that are not classified by the plot as candidate \emph{outliers}.
\item
  An outlier is an unusual point, far from the center of a distribution.
\item
  Note that I've used the \texttt{horizontal} option to show this boxplot in this direction. Most comparison boxplots, as we'll see below, are oriented vertically.
\end{itemize}

The boxplot's \textbf{whiskers} that are drawn from the first and third quartiles (i.e.~the 25\textsuperscript{th} and 75\textsuperscript{th} percentiles) out to the most extreme points in the data that do not meet the standard of ``candidate outliers.'' An outlier is simply a point that is far away from the center of the data - which may be due to any number of reasons, and generally indicates a need for further investigation.

Most software, including R, uses a standard proposed by Tukey which describes a ``candidate outlier'' as any point above the \textbf{\emph{upper fence}} or below the \textbf{\emph{lower fence}}. The definitions of the fences are based on the inter-quartile range (IQR).

If IQR = 75th percentile - 25th percentile, then the upper fence is 75th percentile + 1.5 IQR, and the lower fence is 25th percentile - 1.5 IQR.

So for these \texttt{energy} data,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the upper fence is located at 2306 + 1.5(938.5) = 3713.75
\item
  the lower fence is located at 1367 - 1.5(938.5) = -40.75
\end{itemize}

In this case, we see no points identified as outliers in the low part of the distribution, but quite a few identified that way on the high side. This tends to identify about 5\% of the data as a candidate outlier, \emph{if} the data follow a Normal distribution.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This plot is indicating clearly that there is some asymmetry (skew) in the data, specifically right skew.
\item
  The standard R uses is to indicate as outliers any points that are more than 1.5 inter-quartile ranges away from the edges of the box.
\end{itemize}

The horizontal orientation I've chosen here clarifies the relationship of direction of skew to the plot. A plot like this, with multiple outliers on the right side is indicative of a long right tail in the distribution, and hence, positive or right skew - with the mean being larger than the median. Other indications of skew include having one side of the box being substantially wider than the other, or one side of the whiskers being substantially longer than the other. More on skew later.

The \textbf{trimmed mean} trim value in R indicates proportion of observations to be trimmed from each end of the outcome distribution before the mean is calculated. The \texttt{trimmed} value provided by the \texttt{psych::describe} package describes what this particular package calls a 20\% trimmed mean (bottom and top 10\% of \texttt{energy} values are removed before taking the mean - it's the mean of the middle 80\% of the data.) I might call that a 10\% trimmed mean in some settings, but that's just me.

An alternative to the IQR that is fancier, and a bit more robust, is the \textbf{median absolute deviation}, which, in large sample sizes, for data that follow a Normal distribution, will be (in expectation) equal to the standard deviation. The MAD is the median of the absolute deviations from the median, multiplied by a constant (1.4826) to yield asymptotically normal consistency.

\hypertarget{assessing-skew}{%
\section{Assessing Skew}\label{assessing-skew}}

A relatively common idea is to assess \textbf{skewness}, several measures of which are available. Many models assume a Normal distribution, where, among other things, the data are symmetric around the mean.

Skewness measures asymmetry in the distribution, where left skew (mean \textless{} median) is indicated by negative skewness values, while right skew (mean \textgreater{} median) is indicated by positive values. The skew value will be near zero for data that follow a symmetric distribution.

\hypertarget{non-parametric-skewness}{%
\subsection{Non-parametric Skewness}\label{non-parametric-skewness}}

A simpler measure of skew, sometimes called the \textbf{nonparametric skew} and closely related to Pearson's notion of median skewness, falls between -1 and +1 for any distribution. It is just the difference between the mean and the median, divided by the standard deviation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Values greater than +0.2 are sometimes taken to indicate fairly substantial right skew, while values below -0.2 indicate fairly substantial left skew.

\hypertarget{assessing-kurtosis-heavy-tailedness}{%
\section{Assessing Kurtosis (Heavy-Tailedness)}\label{assessing-kurtosis-heavy-tailedness}}

Another measure of a distribution's shape that can be found in the \texttt{psych} library is the \textbf{kurtosis}. Kurtosis is an indicator of whether the distribution is heavy-tailed or light-tailed as compared to a Normal distribution. Positive kurtosis means more of the variance is due to outliers - unusual points far away from the mean relative to what we might expect from a Normally distributed data set with the same standard deviation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A Normal distribution will have a kurtosis value near 0, a distribution with similar tail behavior to what we would expect from a Normal is said to be \emph{mesokurtic}
\item
  Higher kurtosis values (meaningfully higher than 0) indicate that, as compared to a Normal distribution, the observed variance is more the result of extreme outliers (i.e.~heavy tails) as opposed to being the result of more modest sized deviations from the mean. These heavy-tailed, or outlier prone, distributions are sometimes called \emph{leptokurtic}.
\item
  Kurtosis values meaningfully lower than 0 indicate light-tailed data, with fewer outliers than we'd expect in a Normal distribution. Such distributions are sometimes referred to as \emph{platykurtic}, and include distributions without outliers, like the Uniform distribution.
\end{itemize}

Here's a table:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For a categorical variable, it provides counts of total observations (n), the number of missing values, and the number of unique categories, along with counts and percentages falling in each category.
\item
  For a numerical variable, it provides:
\item
  counts of total observations (n), the number of missing values, and the number of unique values
\item
  an Info value for the data, which indicates how continuous the variable is (a score of 1 is generally indicative of a completely continuous variable with no ties, while scores near 0 indicate lots of ties, and very few unique values)
\item
  the sample Mean
\item
  Gini's mean difference, which is a robust measure of spread, with larger values indicating greater dispersion in the data. It is defined as the mean absolute difference between any pairs of observations.
\item
  many sample percentiles (quantiles) of the data, specifically (5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 95, 99)

\section{What Summaries to Report}\label{what-summaries-to-report}}

It is usually helpful to focus on the shape, center and spread of a distribution. Bock, Velleman and DeVeaux provide some useful advice:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the data are skewed, report the median and IQR (or the three middle quantiles). You may want to include the mean and standard deviation, but you should point out why the mean and median differ. The fact that the mean and median do not agree is a sign that the distribution may be skewed. A histogram will help you make that point.
\item
  If the data are symmetric, report the mean and standard deviation, and possibly the median and IQR as well.
\item
  If there are clear outliers and you are reporting the mean and standard deviation, report them with the outliers present and with the outliers removed. The differences may be revealing. The median and IQR are not likely to be seriously affected by outliers.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assessing-normality}{%
\chapter{Assessing Normality}\label{assessing-normality}}

Data are well approximated by a Normal distribution if the shape of the data's distribution is a good match for a Normal distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to the sample statistics.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the data are symmetrically distributed about a single peak, located at the sample mean
\item
  the spread of the distribution is well characterized by a Normal distribution with standard deviation equal to the sample standard deviation
\item
  the data show outlying values (both in number of candidate outliers, and size of the distance between the outliers and the center of the distribution) that are similar to what would be predicted by a Normal model.
\end{itemize}

We have several tools for assessing Normality of a single batch of data, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a histogram with superimposed Normal distribution
\item
  histogram variants (like the boxplot) which provide information on the center, spread and shape of a distribution
\item
  the Empirical Rule for interpretation of a standard deviation
\item
  a specialized \emph{normal Q-Q plot} (also called a normal probability plot or normal quantile-quantile plot) designed to reveal differences between a sample distribution and what we might expect from a normal distribution of a similar number of values with the same mean and standard deviation
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{empirical-rule-interpretation-of-the-standard-deviation}{%
\section{Empirical Rule Interpretation of the Standard Deviation}\label{empirical-rule-interpretation-of-the-standard-deviation}}

For a set of measurements that follows a Normal distribution, the interval:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mean \(\pm\) Standard Deviation contains approximately 68\% of the measurements;
\item
  Mean \(\pm\) 2(Standard Deviation) contains approximately 95\% of the measurements;
\item
  Mean \(\pm\) 3(Standard Deviation) contains approximately all (99.7\%) of the measurements.
\end{itemize}

Again, most data sets do not follow a Normal distribution. We will occasionally think about transforming or re-expressing our data to obtain results which are better approximated by a Normal distribution, in part so that a standard deviation can be more meaningful.

For the energy data we have been studying, here again are some summary statistics\ldots{}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mosaic}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{favstats}\NormalTok{(nnyfs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{energy)}

\begin{verbatim}
 min     Q1 median   Q3  max     mean       sd    n missing

\end{verbatim}

The mean is 1877 and the standard deviation is 722, so if the data really were Normally distributed, we'd expect to see:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  About 68\% of the data in the range (1155, 2600). In fact, 1085 of the 1518 energy values are in this range, or 71.5\%.
\item
  About 95\% of the data in the range (432, 3322). In fact, 1450 of the 1518 energy values are in this range, or 95.5\%.
\item
  About 99.7\% of the data in the range (-290, 4044). In fact, 1502 of the 1518 energy values are in this range, or 98.9\%.
\end{itemize}

So, based on this Empirical Rule approximation, do the energy data seem to be well approximated by a Normal distribution?

\hypertarget{describing-outlying-values-with-z-scores}{%
\section{Describing Outlying Values with Z Scores}\label{describing-outlying-values-with-z-scores}}

The maximum energy consumption value here is 5265. One way to gauge how extreme this is (or how much of an outlier it is) uses that observation's \textbf{Z score}, the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the observation falls.

Here, the maximum value, 5265 is 4.69 standard deviations above the mean, and thus has a Z score of 4.7.

A negative Z score would indicate a point below the mean, while a positive Z score indicates, as we've seen, a point above the mean. The minimum body-mass index, 257 is 2.24 standard deviations \emph{below} the mean, so it has a Z score of -2.2.

Recall that the Empirical Rule suggests that if a variable follows a Normal distribution, it would have approximately 95\% of its observations falling inside a Z score of (-2, 2), and 99.74\% falling inside a Z score range of (-3, 3).

\hypertarget{fences-and-z-scores}{%
\subsection{Fences and Z Scores}\label{fences-and-z-scores}}

Note the relationship between the fences (Tukey's approach to identifying points which fall within the whiskers of a boxplot, as compared to candidate outliers) and the Z scores.

The upper inner fence in this case falls at 3713.75, which indicates a Z score of 2.5, while the lower inner fence falls at -40.25, which indicates a Z score of -2.7. It is neither unusual nor inevitable for the inner fences to fall at Z scores near -2.0 and +2.0.

\hypertarget{comparing-a-histogram-to-a-normal-distribution}{%
\section{Comparing a Histogram to a Normal Distribution}\label{comparing-a-histogram-to-a-normal-distribution}}

Most of the time, when we want to understand whether our data are well approximated by a Normal distribution, we will use a graph to aid in the decision.

One option is to build a histogram with a Normal density function (with the same mean and standard deviation as our data) superimposed. This is one way to help visualize deviations between our data and what might be expected from a Normal distribution.

Does it seem as though the Normal model (as shown in the blue density curve) is an effective approximation to the observed distribution shown in the bars of the histogram?

We'll return shortly to the questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  Does a Normal distribution model fit our data well? \emph{and}
\item
  If the data aren't Normal, but we want to use a Normal model anyway, what should we do?

The mean is 67.71 and the standard deviation is 15.2 so if the \texttt{waist} data really were Normally distributed, we'd expect to see:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  About 68\% of the data in the range (52.51, 82.9). In fact, 1076 of the 1512 Age values are in this range, or 71.2\%.
\item
  About 95\% of the data in the range (37.31, 98.1). In fact, 1443 of the 1512 Age values are in this range, or 95.4\%.
\item
  About 99.7\% of the data in the range (22.11, 113.3). In fact, 1500 of the 1512 Age values are in this range, or 99.2\%.

\section{The Normal Q-Q Plot}\label{the-normal-q-q-plot}}

A normal probability plot (or normal quantile-quantile plot) of the energy results from the \texttt{nnyfs} data, developed using \texttt{ggplot2} is shown below. In this case, this is a picture of 1518 energy consumption assessments. The idea of a normal Q-Q plot is that it plots the observed sample values (on the vertical axis) and then, on the horizontal, the expected or theoretical quantiles that would be observed in a standard normal distribution (a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1) with the same number of observations.

A Normal Q-Q plot will follow a straight line when the data are (approximately) Normally distributed. When the data have a different shape, the plot will reflect that.

\section{Interpreting the Normal Q-Q Plot}\label{interpreting-the-normal-q-q-plot}}

The purpose of a Normal Q-Q plot is to help point out distinctions from a Normal distribution. A Normal distribution is symmetric and has certain expectations regarding its tails. The Normal Q-Q plot can help us identify data as well approximated by a Normal distribution, or not, because of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  skew (including distinguishing between right skew and left skew)
\item
  behavior in the tails (which could be heavy-tailed {[}more outliers than expected{]} or light-tailed)
\end{itemize}

These simulated data appear to be well-modeled by the Normal distribution, because the points on the Normal Q-Q plot follow the diagonal reference line. In particular,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  there is no substantial curve (such as we'd see with data that were skewed)
\item
  there is no particularly surprising behavior (curves away from the line) at either tail, so there's no obvious problem with outliers

Our conclusion is that a Normal model is a far better fit to the square root of the energy values than it is to the raw energy values.

The effect of taking the square root may be clearer from the histograms below, with Normal models superimposed.

When we are confronted with a variable that is not Normally distributed but that we wish was Normally distributed, it is sometimes useful to consider whether working with a \textbf{transformation} of the data will yield a more helpful result, as the square root does in this instance.

The next Chapter provides some guidance about choosing from a class of power transformations that can reduce the impact of non-Normality in unimodal data.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When we are confronted with a variable that is not Normally distributed but that we wish was Normally distributed, it is sometimes useful to consider whether working with a transformation of the data will yield a more helpful result.
\item
  Many statistical methods, including t tests and analyses of variance, assume Normal distributions.
\item
  We'll discuss using R to assess a range of what are called Box-Cox power transformations, via plots, mainly.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-ladder-of-power-transformations}{%
\section{The Ladder of Power Transformations}\label{the-ladder-of-power-transformations}}

The key notion in re-expression of a single variable to obtain a distribution better approximated by the Normal or re-expression of an outcome in a simple regression model is that of a \textbf{ladder of power transformations}, which applies to any unimodal data.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
Power & Transformation\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
3 & x\textsuperscript{3}\tabularnewline
2 & x\textsuperscript{2}\tabularnewline
1 & x (unchanged)\tabularnewline
0.5 & x\textsuperscript{0.5} = \(\sqrt{x}\)\tabularnewline
0 & ln x\tabularnewline
-0.5 & x\textsuperscript{-0.5} = 1/\(\sqrt{x}\)\tabularnewline
-1 & x\textsuperscript{-1} = 1/x\tabularnewline
-2 & x\textsuperscript{-2} = 1/x\textsuperscript{2}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{using-the-ladder}{%
\section{Using the Ladder}\label{using-the-ladder}}

As we move further away from the \emph{identity} function (power = 1) we change the shape more and more in the same general direction.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For instance, if we try a logarithm, and this seems like too much of a change, we might try a square root instead.
\item
  Note that this ladder (which like many other things is due to John Tukey) uses the logarithm for the ``power zero'' transformation rather than the constant, which is what x\textsuperscript{0} actually is.
\item
  If the variable x can take on negative values, we might take a different approach. If x is a count of something that could be zero, we often simply add 1 to x before transformation.
\end{itemize}

The ladder of power transformations is particularly helpful when we are confronted with data that shows skew.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To handle right skew (where the mean exceeds the median) we usually apply powers below 1.
\item
  To handle left skew (where the median exceeds the mean) we usually apply powers greater than 1.
\end{itemize}

The most common transformations are the square (power 2), the square root (power 1/2), the logarithm (power 0) and the inverse (power -1), and I usually restrict myself to those options in practical work.

As we've seen, the \texttt{protein} data are right skewed, and all of the values are strictly positive. If we want to use the tools of the Normal distribution to describe these data, we might try taking a step ``down'' our ladder from power 1 (raw data) to lower powers.

The newly transformed (cube of the) data appears more symmetric, although somewhat light-tailed. Perhaps a Normal model would be more appropriate now, although the standard deviation is likely to overstate the variation we see in the data due to the light tails. Again, I wouldn't be thrilled using a cube in practical work, as it is so hard to interpret, but it does look like a reasonable choice here.

Suppose we want to understand how the subjects whose diet involved consuming much more than usual yesterday compare to those who consumer their usual amount, or to those who consumed much less than usual, in terms of the energy they consumed, as well as the protein.

Perhaps we should restrict ourselves to the people who were not missing the \texttt{diet\_yesterday} category, and look now at their \texttt{sugar} and \texttt{water} consumption.

Think of them as confidence regions around the medians.

There is no overlap between the notches for each of the four categories, so we might reasonably conclude that the true median triceps skinfold values across the four categories are statistically significantly different.

For an example where the notches do overlap, consider the comparison of plank times by BMI category.

The overlap in the notches (for instance between Underweight and Normal) suggests that the median plank times in the population of interest don't necessarily differ in a meaningful way by BMI category, other than perhaps the Obese group which may have a shorter time.

These data are somewhat right skewed. Would a logarithmic transformation in the plot help us see the patterns more clearly?

Some people don't like violin plots - for example, see \url{https://simplystatistics.org/2017/07/13/the-joy-of-no-more-violin-plots/}. A relatively new alternative plot is available. This shows the distribution of several groups simultaneously, especially when you have lots of subgroup categories, and is called a \textbf{ridgeline plot}.

And here's a ridgeline plot for the triceps skinfolds. We'll start by sorting the subgroups by the median value of our outcome (triceps skinfold) in this case, though it turns out not to matter. We'll also add some color.

For one last example, we'll look at age by BMI category, so that sorting the BMI subgroups by the median matters, and we'll try an alternate color scheme, and a theme specially designed for the ridgeline plot.
